install and start docker
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-rpms
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
sudo subscription-manager repos --enable=rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
sudo yum install docker device-mapper-libs device-mapper-event-libs
sudo systemctl start docker.service
sudo systemctl enable docker.service
pull docker redhat standard image 
sudo docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel
start docker container using the redhat image and directly access bash in docker
sudo docker run -it -v /host_dir/app_dir/:/container_dir/mapped_dir:Z --name mydocker registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel
above command with tag -v can mount any local directory in host machine to a directory in the docker container, so that we can read/write persistent data out of docker container
after execute above command, we will run into bash of standard Redhat OS in the docker container 
install all application code and dependent third party software within the docker bash
yum will be available to install software we need
type exit to exit from docker container after installation is finished/verified
commit change to create a new docker image
sudo docker commit mydocker mydockerimage
mydocker is the name we specify when we start docker container
mydockerimage is the name for the image we want to save
export docker image and upload to oneartifectory web site
sudo docker save  mydockerimage  > mydockerimage.tar
or sudo docker save  mydockerimage | gzip > mydockerimage.tar.gz  
mydockerimage.tar or mydockerimage.tar.gz is the image file that can be uploaded 

To work later in a docker container again:
sudo docker start mydocker
sudo docker attach mydocker
Then you will be in bash of the docker container again.
Other useful docker commands
sudo docker ps -a (list all docker containers, including both running and exited containers)
sudo docker images -a (list all loaded docker images)
sudo docker load -i location_of_local_dockerimage_file  (load docker image from local file)
